  "description": "Benchmark scaffold derived from Airbus SCXML-based SSM. Variants remove concrete state-machine runtime logic (graph construction, event dispatch, transition evaluation). LLM must reconstruct removed sections while preserving interfaces so translated ROS2 version can be validated against the original behavior.",
