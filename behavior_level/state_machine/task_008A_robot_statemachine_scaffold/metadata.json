  "source": "https://github.com/MarcoStb1993/robot_statemachine",
  "description": "Advanced scaffold focused on state lifecycle, transition evaluation and dispatch handling. Variants remove core logic in specific places; LLM must fill in logic maintaining original interfaces and behavior.",
  "ros_versions": {"ros1": "noetic"},
  "language": "python",
  "difficulty": "advanced",
  "todo_files": [
    "rsm_core/state_machine.py",
    "rsm_core/transitions.py",
    "rsm_nodes/robot_node.py"
  ],
  "expected_outcomes": [
    "Variant implementations, once filled, will produce the same state transition sequence as the ORIGINAL for the provided demo scenario.",
    "State.on_enter must initialize timers and log; on_exit must log duration.",
    "Transition.evaluate must return True only when the condition callable (if present) evaluates to True.",
    "StateMachine.run must call current_state.execute(), look up transitions for that state, evaluate transition conditions, perform on_exit/on_enter calls and swap states accordingly."
  ],
  "notes": "Original source files included in ros1_code/src/original/. Each variant file contains one TODO block. README_eval.md contains per-variant validation checklists."
