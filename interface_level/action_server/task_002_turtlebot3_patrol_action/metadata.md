# Task 002: TurtleBot3 Patrol Action

- Level: Basic (interface)
- Type: Action Server
- Purpose: Test LLM understanding of Action Server patterns
- ROS Version: ROS1 Noetic
- difficulty: basic
- Language: Python3
- Key Challenge: High-difficulty action server stub with missing action names, feedback and result fields.

- Notes on “挖空”: Fields in execute_cb and server initialization are left blank to simulate realistic AI fill-in-the-blank scenario.
