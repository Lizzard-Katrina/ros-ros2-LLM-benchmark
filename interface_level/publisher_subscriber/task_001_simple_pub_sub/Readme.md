# Task 001 — Simple Publisher & Subscriber (C++)

### **Objective**
This task evaluates whether a model can translate a basic ROS1 C++ talker/listener pair into an equivalent ROS2 Foxy implementation.

The ROS1 code is intentionally left empty, because this is a well-known canonical example.  
The expected ROS2 code is provided in `expected_ros2_code/`.
