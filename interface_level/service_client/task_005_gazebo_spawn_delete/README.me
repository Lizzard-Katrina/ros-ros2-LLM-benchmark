# Task 005 — Gazebo Spawn/Delete Model

## Description
This task tests if an LLM can correctly complete spawn/delete ROS1 service nodes for Gazebo simulation.

## Why these blanks?
- **Entire try block**: requires understanding ROS service call structure
- **Service names & message types**: often miswritten
- **SDF/XML & Pose/reference frame**: must be correct for spawn
- **CMakeLists / package.xml**: test understanding of catkin build

## Expected Outcome
- Gazebo empty world launches
- Spawn node creates model successfully
- Delete node removes model successfully
- No build/runtime errors
